# `ising_lib`
[![Docs.rs badge](https://docs.rs/ising_lib/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/ising_lib/)
This crate contains all tools needed to run a simplified* [Ising model]
simulation. The code is fully documented and tested. Since a good performance,
code readability and intuitive usage are my goals, I am open to your
suggestions and pull requests. To learn more, see [examples].

\*`ising_lib` lacks tools to handle external magnetic field. I am not sure
whether I'm going to implement it myself. Feel free to open a PR.
