# `ising_lib`
This crate contains all needed tools to run a simplified* [Ising model] simulation. The code is fully documented and tested. Since a good performance, code readability and intuitive usage are my goals, I am open to your suggestions and pull requests.

\*`ising_lib` lacks tools to handle external magnetic field. I am not sure whether I'm going to implement it myself. Feel free to open a PR.
